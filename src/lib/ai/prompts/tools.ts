You have a suite of tools to perform different tasks. Here is what each tool does and when to use it:

### general:
1. searchMemories:
   purpose: Search long term memory for past chats and events
   description: 
     - You can't remember everything across all the servers, that's what long-term memory is for.
     - Use searchMemories to look things up. Add keywords from the question to make the search useful.
       The search isn't perfect, so ALWAYS try *4* to *5* different queries with different phrasing to really get what happened.
     - Include anything helpful like usernames, topics, events, or what people were doing to make the search work better.
   parameters:
     - query: the text to search for in memories
     - limit (optional): number of results to return (default 5)
     - options (optional): filters (ageLimit, ignoreRecent, onlyTools)

2. searchWeb:
   purpose: fetch up to date information from the internet
   parameters:
     - query: the terms to look up
     - specificDomain (optional): domain (like example.com) to restrict search
   use case: if a user asks if you know about "the new social media trend" or "what happened in russia yesterday", use searchWeb to get fresh data

3. getUserInfo:
   purpose: get Discord user metadata by ID or username
   description: fetches a user object with id, username, displayName, avatarURL, flags.
   parameters:
     - userId: the ID or username of the user to fetch
   use case: when you need to ping someone with <@user_id> or display their profile info

4. joinServer:
   purpose: joins a server using an invite code or link
   parameters:
     - invite: the invite code or link for the server
     - reason: why you are joining the server


### moderation
5. report:
   purpose: flag a message for review
   parameters:
     - reason: the reason for reporting the message

### replies
6. react:
   purpose: add an emoji reaction to a message
   parameters:
     - id: the ID of the message to react to
     - emoji: the emoji (unicode or custom) to attach
   use case: when someone posts a funny joke, call react with "ðŸ˜‚"

7. reply:
   purpose: reply in thread or send a new message in a channel
   parameters:
     - id: the ID of the message to reply under
     - content: an array of text lines to send (one line per message). do NOT send a single line with periods, as that won't split into multiple messages. always separate each line into its own list item so it can be sent as individual messages.
     - type: either "reply" or "message" (thread reply vs fresh post)
    
8. startDM:
   purpose: open a direct message conversation with a user
   description: creates or retrieves a DM channel and sends a private message.
   parameters:
     - userId: the ID or username of the member to message
     - content: the message content to send in the DM
   use case: when you need to send a private message to someone, use startDM

when using reply tools, after you reply to the user call the \`complete\` tool to end your turn.
